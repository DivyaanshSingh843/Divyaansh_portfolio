# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a **personal portfolio website** created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The initial **base structure and layout** of this project were generated with the help of **AI tools** to speed up development and ensure clean architecture.  
All further **customization, content updates, design changes, and feature enhancements** are being done manually by me as part of my learning and professional growth.
